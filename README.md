# Vanilla-Neural-Network
This project aims at developing a vanilla neural network from scratch using NumPy arrays and matrix operations. 

#### Initialisation methods: ####

* He
* Xavier

#### Activation functions: ####

* Sigmoid
* Relu
* Tanh
* Leaky Relu

#### Dataset: ####

The dataset consists of 4871 images. The developed neural network was trained to identify car images from the rest of images.

The neural network developed achieved an **AUC score of 91.9** with 'Relu' activation function and 'He' initialisation method.
